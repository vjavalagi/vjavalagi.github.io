                    Hello, I am currently a Junior at Texas A&M University pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I chose to study computer science because 
                I love to problem solve. However, coming to college, it felt isolating being in such a male-dominated field. 
                I wanted to find a welcoming community on campus that also shared my interests, that's why I joined Aggie Women in Computer Science
                 (
                    <a href="https://www.awics.org/" target="_blank">AWiCS</a>
                    ). I started as a freshman in the club and have held multiple roles over the years. Initially, 
                I was a Workshops Officer my freshman year, the Secretary my sophomore year, and now I have the honor of serving as the Vice President. 
                This organization has provided me with the opportunity to attend the
                    <a href="https://ghc.anitab.org/" target="_blank">Grace Hopper Conference</a>
                    this year. It is designed to celebrate women in computer 
                science roles. Did you know that Grace Hopper recorded the "
                    <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/worlds-first-computer-bug/" target="_blank">first computer bug</a>
                    found"? Funny enough, It was a moth found in the 
                Harvard Mark II computer. I am very excited to attend this conference at the end of September and get to network with other professionals and attend 
                technical workshops as well.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also like to teach Computer Science concepts. The field gets a bad rap for being very hard to learn and challenging, but I believe a good teacher
                 makes all the difference. That's why in high school I began running Intro to Java camps for middle school students because I didn't want other kids - 
                 especially young girls to have the same fears as me. I have taken this interest in teaching into college where I went to elementary schools with the
                    <a href="https://www.swetamu.com/" target="_blank">Society of Women in Engineering</a>
                    to hold Engage Visits that teach middle school classes different
                  STEM concepts. Additionally, I currently work for the 
                 Texas A&M Computer Science and Computer Engineering
                    <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html" target="_blank">department</a>
                    as a
                    <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/academics/peer-teachers/current-peer-teachers.html" target="_blank">Peer Teacher</a>
                    , where I hold office 
                 hours for previous courses I have completed. I also attend the CSCE 120, intro to C++ course, twice weekly to help students during their lab time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am very passionate about computer science and am curious by nature. I like learning new skills and I am open to work. Currently, I'm looking
                 for a Summer 2024 internship in a SWE role. I have previously worked two internships in Houston at
                    <a href="https://pros.com/" target="_blank">PROS</a>
                    and I can bring a lot to the table.
