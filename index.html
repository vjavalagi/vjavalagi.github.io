                    Hello, I am currently a Junior at Texas A&M University pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 
                    My journey in technology has been defined by both teaching and leadership. As a Peer Teacher, I've had the privilege of sharing my passion for coding, helping fellow students unlock their potential, and fostering an inclusive learning environment. Serving as President of Aggie Women in Computer Science, I've dedicated myself to building a community that empowers and celebrates women in tech. I've also had the privilege of interning twice at PROS, where I gained hands-on experience and insight into the industry. 
                    My drive to excel in software engineering is fueled by these experiences. I'm excited to bring my skills in problem-solving, coding, and teamwork to my work. I'm eager to contribute to innovative projects, learn from mentors, and make a meaningful impact in the world of technology.
