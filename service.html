                <p>
                    I have attended this camp since I was in the 3rd grade, it has helped me grow into my identity and I want to bring that message back to
                     my community so I volunteer every summer to help
                    <a href="https://www.hinducamp.net/" target="_blank">HHYC</a>. I have now served as a counselor for 2 years. As a counselor, I volunteered 
                     at meetings over the summer to organize and execute the 5-day overnight youth camp. I taught the children about religion and culture 
                     and managed the elementary group of 3rd, 4th, and 5th graders throughout the week. In my second year as shown in the image to the left,
                      I counseled the middle school campers.
                    <br>
                    This past year I was a coordinator, meaning I was in charge of a team of 20 elementary counselors to ensure there is a supportive and 
                    enriching environment for 60+ campers to learn about their Hindu heritage. In this role, I have the same duties as a counselor but I also work on risk management and reviewing lesson plans.

                    <p>
                        As a freshman in college, it was very hard for me to navigate college as well as the ETAM process. The Rubies program is a "Big-Little"
                    Mentorship program, run by Aggie Women in Computer Science, that works to pair upperclassmen with underclassmen. I used the program as a freshman and sophomore and am now serving 
                    as a Mentor. This was very helpful for me in understanding the process of job applications, internships, classes, and ETAM. I hope I can 
                    provide that help to the people I get paired with.
