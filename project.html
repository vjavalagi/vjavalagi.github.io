                    My project during my first internship at PROS was front-end based. I worked on improving
                     the data visibility of UI to aid in customer requests primarily using the React.Js 
                     framework. I was able to conduct TypeScript testing for each advancement and used Git to 
                     add changes to each version release. In this process, I also participated in daily scrums 
                     and used the Agile framework with my team.

                    The project from my second internship at PROS was Quality Engineering focused with a side
                     project using back-end and the Azure cloud base. I was able to optimize the testing 
                     process for a PROS product to verify the integrity of the output by implementing 
                     end-to-end XML regression tests invoked by script files. The previous approach required 
                     tedious manual testing per release. To do this I had to leverage APIs, SAS keys, and Azure 
                     SDK packages to create a Java program to streamline the cleanup of Azure Storage

                    In my CSCE 315 Class we are creating a personal webpage, the one you are viewing right now to learn about
                     web development. The website is constructed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript only. 
                     It is also hosted on a public domain and displays my technical knowledge, and community 
                     involvement, to introduce me.

                    and I recently watched a docuserious on how it was created.
                     It was inspiring, my goal is to create a sort of extension for the application. I want it to 
                     use listener data to create a statistics page for user to see their listening
                      behavior or compatibility with other users. 
                       I would also like this project to cover all aspects of the stack because I would like to get familiarized with full stack development.
