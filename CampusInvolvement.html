                <p>
                    Every summer, post high school graduation, I have volunteered as a Counselor at the Hindu Heritage Youth Camp (HHYC). In this role, I participate in weekly meetings throughout the summer to organize and execute the 5-day overnight camp. This past year, I stepped up to become the Elementary Coordinator, a position in which I led all of the Elementary School Counselors. This opportunity allowed me to enhance my leadership and organizational skills while ensuring that logistics were meticulously managed.
                    As a counselor I managed 120+ Elementary and Middle School campers, and as a Coordinator I managed around 20 Counselors.

                    <p>
                        As a freshman in college, it was very hard for me to navigate college as well as the ETAM process. The Rubies program is a "Big-Little"
                    Mentorship program, run by Aggie Women in Computer Science, that pairs upperclassmen with underclassmen. I previously was a mentee and now serve
                    as a mentor. This program guided me through job applications, classes, and TAMU's Entry to a Major. I hope to provide that help to my "rubies"!
